========================================
SQL EXAMPLES 
========================================
Sr.No.	Statement & Description
1.	WHERE SALARY LIKE '200%'

Finds any values that start with 200.

2.	WHERE SALARY LIKE '%200%'

Finds any values that have 200 in any position/field.

3.	WHERE SALARY LIKE '_00%'

Finds any values that have 00 in the second and third positions.

4.	WHERE SALARY LIKE '2_%_%'

Finds any values that start with 2 and are at least 3 characters in length.

5.	WHERE SALARY LIKE '%2'

Finds any values that end with 2.

6.	WHERE SALARY LIKE '_2%3'

Finds any values that have a 2 in the second position and end with a 3.

7.	WHERE SALARY LIKE '2___3'

Finds any values in a five-digit number that start with 2 and end with 3.

Let us take a real example, consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records.

+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
|  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |
|  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |
|  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 |
|  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 |
|  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 |
|  7 | Muffy    |  24 | Indore    | 10000.00 |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
The following code block is an example, which would display all the records from the CUSTOMERS table where the SALARY starts with 200.

SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY LIKE '200%';
This would produce the following result.

+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
|  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
